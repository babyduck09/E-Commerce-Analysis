###  DATA   ANALYSIS

 #### 1. What is the total revenue generated by Olist, and how has it changed over time?
 Firstly, we need to calculate time range of the dataset
```sql
SELECT 
	MIN(order_purchase_timestamp) AS started_date,
	MAX(order_purchase_timestamp) AS ended_date
FROM orders;
```
<img src="code_snapshot\date_range.png" width="200" />

Sales data generated by Olist is from 2016-09-04 21:15:19 to	2018-10-17 17:30:18
```sql
-- create a view to hold orders that were delivered to customers and aren't canceled status
CREATE VIEW valid_orders AS 
SELECT   
    order_id
FROM orders
WHERE 
    order_delivered_customer_date IS NOT NULL AND
    order_status <> 'canceled';
-- total revenue of valid orders   
SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(payment_value),2) AS total_revenue
FROM order_payments 
WHERE 
order_id IN (
SELECT * 
FROM valid_orders
);
```
<img src="code_snapshot\total_revenue.png" width="130" />

Let see how Olist revenue change over time
```sql
-- revenue change by quarter
SELECT 
        YEAR(O.order_purchase_timestamp) AS The_year,
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(O.order_purchase_timestamp) IN (1,2,3) THEN P.payment_value ELSE 0 END),2) AS Qt1,
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(O.order_purchase_timestamp) IN (4,5,6) THEN P.payment_value ELSE 0 END),2) AS Qt2,
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(O.order_purchase_timestamp) IN (7,8,9) THEN P.payment_value ELSE 0 END),2) AS Qt3,
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(O.order_purchase_timestamp) IN (10,11,12) THEN P.payment_value ELSE 0 END),2) AS Qt4
FROM 
    orders AS O
LEFT JOIN order_payments AS P
    ON O.order_id = P.order_id
WHERE 
    O.order_id IN (SELECT * FROM valid_orders)
GROUP BY The_year
ORDER BY The_year ASC; 
```   
<img src="code_snapshot\revenue_over_time.png" width="350" />

```sql
-- revenue change by month
SELECT 
        MONTH(O.order_purchase_timestamp) AS The_month,
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(O.order_purchase_timestamp) = 2016 THEN P.payment_value ELSE 0 END),2) AS 2016_revenue,
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(O.order_purchase_timestamp) = 2017 THEN P.payment_value ELSE 0 END),2) AS 2017_revenue,
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(O.order_purchase_timestamp) = 2018 THEN P.payment_value ELSE 0 END),2) AS 2018_revenue
FROM 
	orders AS O
LEFT JOIN order_payments AS P
        ON O.order_id = P.order_id
WHERE 
	O.order_id IN (SELECT * FROM valid_orders)
GROUP BY The_month
ORDER BY The_month ASC;
```

#### 2. How many orders were placed on Olist, and how does this vary by month or season? 
```sql
SELECT -- Total Order  by Year and Season
        YEAR(order_purchase_timestamp) AS The_year,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN MONTH(order_purchase_timestamp) IN (3,4,5) THEN order_id END) AS spring,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN MONTH(order_purchase_timestamp) IN (6,7,8) THEN order_id END) AS summer,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN MONTH(order_purchase_timestamp) IN (9,10,11) THEN order_id END) AS autumn,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN MONTH(order_purchase_timestamp) IN (12,1,2) THEN order_id END) AS winter
FROM 
	orders 
WHERE 
	order_id IN (SELECT * FROM valid_orders)
GROUP BY The_year
ORDER BY The_year ASC; 
```   
<img src="code_snapshot\total_order_season.png" width="300" />

```sql
SELECT -- Total Order by Year and Month
        MONTH(order_purchase_timestamp) AS The_month,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN YEAR(order_purchase_timestamp) = 2016 THEN order_id END) AS 2016_total_orders,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN YEAR(order_purchase_timestamp) = 2017 THEN order_id END) AS 2017_total_orders,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN YEAR(order_purchase_timestamp) = 2018 THEN order_id END) AS 2018_total_orders
FROM 
	orders 
WHERE 
	order_id IN (SELECT * FROM valid_orders)
GROUP BY 
	The_month
ORDER BY 
	The_month ASC; 
```

#### 3. What are the most popular product categories on Olist, and how do their sales volumes compare to each other? 
What are the top-selling products on Olist, and how have their sales trends changed over time?  
```sql
WITH most_popular_products AS (
SELECT 
	P.product_category_name,
        COUNT(O.order_id) AS total_order
FROM 
	products AS P    
LEFT JOIN 
	order_items AS O ON  P.product_id = O.product_id
WHERE 
	O.order_id IN (SELECT * FROM valid_orders)
GROUP BY 
	P.product_category_name
ORDER BY 
	total_order DESC)
SELECT
	product_category_name,
        total_order,
        ROUND((total_order/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_items WHERE order_id IN (SELECT * FROM valid_orders) ))*100,2) AS percentage_of_order
FROM  most_popular_products
GROUP BY product_category_name;
```
<img src="code_snapshot\most_po_product.png" width="350" />  

```sql
WITH rank_product AS (
-- total orders of top 3 product category for each year
SELECT
    YEAR(R.order_purchase_timestamp) AS The_year,
    P.product_category_name,
    COUNT(O.order_id) AS total_orders,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(O.order_id) DESC) AS  rank_pc
FROM products AS P
LEFT JOIN 
    order_items AS O ON P.product_id = O.product_id
LEFT JOIN
    orders AS R ON R.order_id = O.order_id
WHERE 
    O.order_id IN (SELECT * FROM valid_orders)
GROUP BY 
    The_Year,P.product_category_name
ORDER BY
    The_year ASC)
SELECT 
    The_year,
    product_category_name,
    total_orders,
    rank_pc
FROM rank_product    
WHERE 
    rank_pc < 11
ORDER BY rank_pc ASC;
```
<img src="code_snapshot\top_pro_year.png" width="350" /> 

#### 4. What is the average order value (AOV) on Olist, and how does this vary by product category or payment method?
AOV is a crucial metric in understanding the performance of overall products compared to the cost per order (CPO). It allows a business to determine the performance of each product.

AOV = total revenue / total orders

CPO = total cost of product / total orders
```sql
-- The average order value (AOV) of Olist revenue
WITH total_r AS (
SELECT 
	ROUND(SUM(P.payment_value),2) AS total_revenue
FROM order_payments p
JOIN valid_orders V 
    ON V.order_id = P.order_id 
),
total_c AS (
SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(I.price + I.freight_value),2) AS total_cost 
FROM order_items I
JOIN valid_orders V 
    ON V.order_id = I.order_id 
),
AOV_CPO AS(
SELECT
    ROUND(total_revenue / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT P.order_id) FROM order_payments P JOIN valid_orders V ON V.order_id = P.order_id),2) AS AOV,
    ROUND(total_cost / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT I.order_id) FROM order_items I JOIN valid_orders V ON V.order_id = I.order_id ),2) AS CPO
FROM total_r, total_c)
SELECT 
    AOV,
    CPO,
    ROUND((AOV-CPO),2) AS profit_per_order
FROM AOV_CPO;
```
<img src="code_snapshot\AVO.png" width="250" />
>

```sql
-- the average order value (AOV)  by product category
SELECT
    P.product_category_name,
    av.AOV,
    cp.CPO,
    ROUND(av.AOV-cp.CPO,2) AS profit_per_pc
FROM products AS P
JOIN 
(SELECT 
    P.product_category_name,
    ROUND(AVG(payment_value),2) AS AOV
FROM products P
JOIN order_items AS I
ON I.product_id = P.product_id
JOIN 
 ( SELECT
        P.order_id,
        P.payment_value
    FROM order_payments P 
    JOIN valid_orders V 
        ON P.order_id = V.order_id
    ) AS po ON po.order_id = I.order_id
GROUP BY P.product_category_name
) AS av ON P.product_category_name = av.product_category_name
JOIN
(SELECT 
    P.product_category_name,
    ROUND(AVG(COALESCE(I.price, 0) + COALESCE(I.freight_value, 0)), 2)  AS CPO
FROM products P
JOIN order_items AS I
    ON I.product_id = P.product_id
JOIN valid_orders V 
    ON V.order_id = I.order_id
GROUP BY P.product_category_name) AS cp ON cp.product_category_name = P.product_category_name 
GROUP BY P.product_category_name
ORDER BY profit_per_pc DESC;
```
<img alt="hangxd" src="code_snapshot\AVO_product.png" width="350" />


```sql
-- the average order value (AOV) by payment method
SELECT 
    P.payment_type,
    ROUND(AVG(P.payment_value),2) AS AVO
FROM order_payments AS P
JOIN valid_orders AS V ON V.order_id = P.order_id
GROUP BY payment_type;
```

### 5. How many sellers are active on Olist, and how does this number change over time?
 Active seller is a seller who added a new listing in the last 30 days 

```sql

SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT seller_id) AS active_seller_count
FROM (
	SELECT 
		*,
		DATEDIFF(order_purchase_timestamp,previous_purchase_timestamp) AS date_diff
	FROM (
		SELECT

		JOIN valid_orders V 
			ON OO.order_id = V.order_id
		GROUP BY 
			O.seller_id, O.order_id, OO.order_purchase_timestamp, O.order_id
		) AS seller_order_date
	 HAVING date_diff <= 30
) AS active_sellers ;
```
<img src="code_snapshot\active_seller.png" width="150" />


```sql
-- active sellers by months and years
SELECT
	MONTH(order_purchase_timestamp) AS The_month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN YEAR(order_purchase_timestamp) = 2016 THEN seller_id END) AS 2016_active_sellers,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN YEAR(order_purchase_timestamp) = 2017 THEN seller_id END) AS 2017_active_sellers,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN YEAR(order_purchase_timestamp) = 2018 THEN seller_id END) AS 2018_active_sellers
FROM (

		GROUP BY 
			O.seller_id, O.order_id, OO.order_purchase_timestamp, O.order_id
		) AS seller_order_date
	 HAVING date_diff <= 30
) AS active_sellers 
GROUP BY The_month;
```
<img src="code_snapshot\active_sale_year.png" width="450" />

#### 6. What is the distribution of seller ratings on Olist, and how does this impact sales performance?
```sql
-- distribution of ratings on Olist
SELECT 
    review_score,
    COUNT(review_score) AS total_review,
    ROUND(COUNT(review_score)/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_items)*100,2) AS review_percent
FROM 
	order_reviews 
GROUP BY review_score
ORDER BY review_score DESC;  
```  
<img src="code_snapshot\seller_rating.png" width="250" />

In this dataset provided by Olist, one order can have mutiple review, so we chose the highest review for that order
```sql
-- how review score impact sale performance
WITH rank_review_order_id AS
(SELECT 
    review_score,
    order_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY order_id ORDER BY review_score DESC) AS rank_sc  
FROM order_reviews)
SELECT
    review_score,
    ROUND(SUM(payment_value),2) AS total_sales,
    ROUND((SUM(payment_value)/
    (SELECT SUM(payment_value) FROM order_payments WHERE order_id IN (SELECT * FROM valid_orders)))*100,2) AS sale_percent
FROM 
    rank_review_order_id R
JOIN order_payments P
    ON P.order_id = R.order_id
WHERE 
    rank_sc = 1 AND P.order_id IN (SELECT * FROM valid_orders)

Net promoter score (NPS) is a market research metric that is based on a single survey question asking respondents to rate the likelihood that they would recommend a company, product, or a service to a friend or colleague.
To calculate your Net Promoter Score, subtract the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters:  NPS = % promoters - % detractors
```sql

	promotor_percent,
        detractor_percent,
	promotor_percent- detractor_percent AS nps_score
FROM    
    (SELECT
        ROUND(positive_review/total_count * 100,2) AS promotor_percent,

FROM    
    (SELECT
        COUNT(CASE WHEN review_score IN (4,5) THEN review_id END) AS positive_review,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN review_score = 1 THEN review_id END) AS negative_review,
        COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM order_reviews) AS rs)AS nps;
